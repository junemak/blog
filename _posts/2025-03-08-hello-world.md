Our web application to ease data entry processes just went live about a month back and I conducted my first focus group discussion as a Product Manager! Our project kicked off with a pilot group of ~20 users and we wanted to hear from them on their experience using the app. 

## Setting The Purpose and Agenda

It is good practice to start by sharing with the participants (in this case, the users of the app) the purpose behind the session. The clients (the people we have been liaising with for this project) were quick to address the room and as they knew the users better but they weren't as clear when sharing with them why the users were invited to the focus group discussion. 

I should have communicated with the clients earlier that I will be chairing the session and be the one sharing the purpose instead. I should have also given a brief overview of the various topics we would be discussing for the users to have a clearer idea on the agenda and to signal that I would be guiding the discussion.

## Steering The Conversation

As the clients and users interact with each other very often, the discussion takes on a more casual tone. Thus, there were times where it became more conversational and less structured. As this was my first time facilitating, I prioritised hearing more feedback but realised that it makes the session less meaninigful if it became an open-feedback discussion. I should have been more assertive to rein in the discussion when it goes off-track. 

I learnt that a good focus group discussion is not about having everyone freely sharing their opinions, but a guided discussion where feedback is gathered strategically to answer points identified by the product manager as laid out in the agenda. 

## Sifting Out What Users Really Mean
When a user gives feedback that no one else has, it is easier to label it as an anomaly or a personal preference. The discussion can then carry on and address the rest of items on the agenda.

However, it can be more beneficial instead to probe further into the feedback for a clearer understanding of what the user is actually trying to say; the users themselves may not know it without a facilitated discussion.
