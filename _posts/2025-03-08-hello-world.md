Our web application to ease data entry processes just went live about a month back and I conducted my first focus group discussion as a Product Manager! Our project kicked off with a pilot group of ~20 users and we wanted to hear from them on their experience using the app. 

## Setting The Tone

It is good practice to start off with an introduction on the purpose behind the session. As the clients we have been coordinating with were present, I thought it better that they gave the introduction instead of me due to them having a better relationship with the users. This was a mistake as they did not know the product as well as me and a clearer explanation by the Product Manager would have been the right approach.

I should have also given a brief overview of the various topics we would be discussing for the users to have a clearer idea on the agenda and to signal that I would be guiding the discussion.
