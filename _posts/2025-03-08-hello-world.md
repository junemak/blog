Our web application to ease data entry processes just went live about a month back and I conducted my first focus group discussion as a Product Manager! Our project kicked off with a pilot group of ~20 users and we wanted to hear from them on their experience using the app. 

## Setting The Tone

It is good practice to start by sharing with the participants (in this case, the users of the app) the purpose behind the session. The clients (the people we have been liaising with for this project) were quick to address the room and as they knew the users better but they weren't as clear when sharing with them why the users were invited to the focus group discussion. 

I should have communicated with the clients earlier that I will be chairing the session and be the one sharing the purpose instead. I should have also given a brief overview of the various topics we would be discussing for the users to have a clearer idea on the agenda and to signal that I would be guiding the discussion.
